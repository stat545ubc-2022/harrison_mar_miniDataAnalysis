# harrison_mar_miniDataAnalysis

This repository contains separate folders with the markdown files for milestones 1 and 2 of the mini data analysis project, along with an output file with a summary table from milestone 1 and a ".rds"" file of a model object from milestone 2. 

There are additional ".gitignore" and ".Rproj" files in this repository. ".gitignore" indicates which files git should ignore when committing and pushing, and ".Rproj" details the project settings and is a shortcut for opening the project directly form the filesystem.
