## How to Run Repository Files
If working on a local branch:
1. Initiate your local git repository with
```
  $git init
```
2. Clone this repository into your local using
```
  $git clone https://github.com/stat545ubc-2022/harrison_mar_miniDataAnalysis.git
```
 3. Using your favorite IDE, you can now run the given file from the terminal. For instance, if there was a python file that contained a function to print "Hello world" named helloworld.py, you could run it with:
```
  $python helloworld.py
  >>>Hello world!
```
